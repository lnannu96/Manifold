WARNING:tensorflow:11 out of the last 11 calls to <function Hypersurface.num_FS_volume_form_tf at 0x7f73746d2f28> triggered tf.function retracing. Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors.
